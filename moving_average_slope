// Moving Average Slope System
// 
// This is a simple and effective trading system based on the slopes of 2 moving averages.
// It should capture moves during trending markets but is susceptible to drawdown during choppy periods.
// The fast ma is used for buy/sell signals and the slow ma is used to determine the overall trend so that 
// we long during bullish periods and short during bearish periods.
// For each ma you can also configure the rising/falling length.


//Inputs
fast_len = intInput("Fast",10) 
slow_len = intInput("Slow",200)
fast_rising_len = intInput("Fast rising length", 1)
fast_close_rising_len = intInput("Fast close rising length", 1)
slow_rising_len = intInput("Slow rising length", 1)

//Indicators
fast = sma(close, fast_len)
slow = sma(close, slow_len)

//Conditions
slow_rising = rising(slow, slow_rising_len)
slow_falling = falling(slow, slow_rising_len)

fast_rising = rising(fast, fast_rising_len)
fast_falling = falling(fast, fast_rising_len)

fast_close_falling = falling(fast, fast_close_rising_len)
fast_close_rising = rising(fast, fast_close_rising_len)

//Signals

long_close = fast_close_falling
short_entry = and( and(fast_falling, slow_falling), not(position_short) )

//Plot
